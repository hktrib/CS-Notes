There are certain methods from javascript that are avaiable to use.

In javascript we would have to use window.setInterval or just setInterval.

However, there is no Window object in node.js (hint: we aren't interacting with a window). 

	_dirname -> this is a variable that always tells the absolute path to current file (excluding the current file itself)
	_filename -> same as _dirname + current file name

*Networking issues severly affect the performance, fault-tolerance, and security of distributed systems*

###### Latency
- Delay or the time it takes for a packet to travel from source to desitination router

###### Bandwidth
- Data transfer rate or capacity of a communication channel between a source and destination router


**Formula: Bandwith (bit/s) x Latency(s) gives the *total number of bits in flight***

- As the B * L increases, the ***uncertainty*** or the number of bits lost increases as well
- A High B * L value leads to "Buffer Bloat" -> which is increased latency and network delay

|   **Networking Issue**  |  **How it affects Distr. Sys. Design**    |
|:-----|:-----|
|   **Performance**  |   Affects Latency and data-transfer-rate of messages   |
|   **Scalability**   |  Size of Internet is increasing. Expect greater traffic in future.   |
|   **Reliability**   |  Detect communication errors and perform error-checks at the application layer   |
|   **Security**   |   Install firewalls. Deploy end-to-end authentication, privacy and security modules.   |
|   **Mobility**   |   Expect intermittent connection for mobile devices.   |
|   **Quality-of-service**   |   Internet is best-effort. It is hard to ensure strict QoS guarantees for, say, multimedia messages.   |


#### Network Classifications
1. Based on size
	- Body Area Networks (BAN)
	- Personal Area Networks (PAN)
	- Local Area Networks (LAN)
	- Wide Area Networks (WAN)
3. Based on technology
	- Ethernet Networks
	- Wireless Networks
	- Cellular Networks

##### Body Area Networks (BAN)
- Devices in this network are wearable computing units
- Several Body Sensor Units (BSU's) communicate with the Body Central Unit (BCU)
- Typically low-cost and low-energy networking
	- E.G Data transferred from these sensor units to external storage via 2G (GPRS)/ 3G (UMTS) connections (mobile data to be precise)

##### Personal Area Networks (PAN)
- PAN connects various digital devices carried by user together (mobiles, tablets, cameras)
- Low-Cost and Low-Energy Networking
	- E.G BlueTooth

#### Local Area Networks (LAN)
- Computers connected by single communication medium
	- e.g Twisted Copper Wire, optical fiber, 
- High Data-transfer-rate (DTR) and low latency
- **LAN consists of:**
	- Segment
		- Usually within a departmant/floor
		- **Shared bandwidth, no routing necessary**
	- Local Networks
		- Serves campus/office building
		- **Many segments connected by a switch/hub**
		- Typically, represents a network within an organization

#### Wide Area Networks (WAN)
- Generally covers a wider area (cities, countries, .....)
- Consists of networks of different organizations
- Traffic is routed from one organization to another
	- Routers
- Bandwidth and Latency
	- Varies 
	- Worse than LAN
- **LARGEST WAN -> Internet**

#### Types of Networks – Based on Technology
- **Ethernet Networks**
	- Predominantly used in the wired Internet
- **Wireless LANs** -> WIFI
	- Primarily designed to provide wireless access to the Internet
	- Low-Range (100s of meters), high-bandwidth
- **Cellular networks (2G/3G/4G)**
	- Initially, designed to carry voice
	- Large Range (few kms)
	- Low-Bandwith

#### Networking Protocols
- If two entities want to communicate on a network, pre-defined agreements are necessary
	- How many bits should be used to signal a 0-bit or a 1-bit?
	- How does the receiver know the last bit in the message?
	- How can a receiver detect if the message is damaged?
- “Protocol” is a well-known set of rules and formats to be used for communication between the entities
- Standardizing a well-known set of protocols supports communication among heterogeneous entities

#### Packet Transmission
- Messages are broken up into packets
- Maximum size of the packet is known as Maximum Transmission Unit (**MTU**)
- Each packet has two main fields
	- Header: Contains meta-information about the packet
		- e.g., Length of the packet, receiver ID
	- Data
- ![[Pasted image 20231030220634.png]]

#### Network Layers
- Network software is arranged into a hierarchy of layers
	- Protocols in one layer perform one specific functionality
	- Layering is a scalable and modular design for complex software
- Typical functionalities in a network software

### Phyiscal Link Layer (PLL)
- *Physical Layer protocols transmit a sequence of bits over a transmission medium*
	- Modulate the bits into signals that can be transmitted over the medium
	- ![[Pasted image 20231030222419.png]]
### Data Link Layer (DLL)
- *Protocols in a DLL ensure that the packets are delivered from one host to another within a local network*
- DLL protocols provide two main functionalities 
	- How to coordinate between the transmitters such that packets are successfully received?
		- **Coordination**
	- How to identify another host on the local network?
		- **Addressing over Local Networks**

### Coordination at the DLL
- A packet is not received successfully at the receiver if a sender transmits the data when another sender’s transmission is active
	- The packet is said to have experienced **collision** if it is not *successfully received at the receiver*
- ***Collision is avoided by sensing the medium before transmission***
- ![[Pasted image 20231030230731.png]]

### Addressing over Local Networks
- Each device that is connected to a network has a unique address called Medium Access Control (MAC) address
	- MAC addresses are six bytes long
		- e.g., 2A:D4:AB:FD:EF:8D
			- Hex is 4 bits
- Approach:
	- Data-link layer ***broadcasts*** the packet over the medium
	- Receiver reads the packet header and checks if the packet is addressed to it


### Network Layer
- Network layer protocols perform the role of **routing**
	- They **ensure** that a packet is routed from the source machine to the destination machine
	- Packets may traverse different LANs to reach the destination
- **Internet Protocol (IP)** is a widely-used network layer protocol
	- IP addresses are typically used to identify machines (their LAN location) in the network
		- MAC Addresses further distinguish in the LAN data-link layer (DLL Addressing)
		- ![[Pasted image 20231030231810.png]]


### Router
- A **router** is a device that forwards the packets between multiple networks
- Routers are connected to 2 or more networks
	- Each Network interface is connected to a LAN or a host
- Packet travels up until the network layer on the router

### Communicating Entities in Distributed Systems
- System-oriented entities
	- Processes
	- Threads
	- Nodes
- Problem-oriented entities
	- Objects (in object-oriented programming based approaches)

### 3 Types of Communication Paradigms
- ### 1. Same Address Space
	- Global Variables
	- Direct Procedure calls
- ### 2. Same Computer but Different Address Space
	- #### Files: 
		- Processes can communicate by reading from and writing to shared files. One process writes data to a file, and another process reads that data from the file. 
	- #### Signals: 
		- Signals are software interrupts or notifications sent by one process to another. They are used for various purposes, such as notifying a process to terminate, handling exceptional conditions, or even custom communication between processes.
	- #### Shared Memory:
		- Shared memory is a mechanism that allows two or more processes to share a portion of their memory space. Instead of direct memory access, these processes map a common memory area into their address spaces, allowing them to read and write data to that shared memory segment.
- ### 3. Networked Computers
	- Socket Communication
	- Remote Invocation
		- These can be considered Middleware Layers in the Network Layers (Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Primitives Layer for things like Sockets and the Remote Invocation layer above that)
		- They are software paradigms for working with the transport layer.
		- The actual software libraries would still be part of the Application Layer, but its best classified as being **MIDDLEWARE**

UDP sockets
Server creates a socket SS on known port SN
Server waits for client connection
Client creates a socket CS on port CN
Client sends message to ServerIP on known port SN

packet reaches IP then gets multiplexed to the correct port SN

Server may never send response
Packet may have never reacherd -> packet collision because of buffer overflow

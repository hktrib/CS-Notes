### Routing Algorithm
- Packets have to be transmitted in a series of hops through the routers
	- The series of hops a packet takes is called a route
- **Routing Algorithm** is responsible for determining the routes for the transmission of packets
- Challenges for designing routing algorithms in the internet
	- Performance: The traffic across different networks vary
	- Router Failuires: The routers in the internet might fail

### Routing Algorithm Activities
- Routing algorithms have 2 activities
	- Determine the **next-hop** to take for each packet
		- Algo shld be fast and efficient
	- Dynamically update connectivity information
		- Maintain up-to-date knowledge of the network by monitoring the routers and traffic
- The above activities are distributed throughout the network
	- Routing decisions are made on an hop-by-hop basis
	- Information about possible next-hop routers is stored locally
	- Information is updated periodically (i.e imagine Routers getting data about which network/router child/grandchild of their is down)

### Distance Vector Algorithm
- Distance Vector (DV) uses graph theoretical algorithms to find the best route in the network
	- It uses a well-known shortest path algorithm called Bellman-Ford algorithm
- Two activities for the DV routing algorithm:
	- Determining the best next-hop at each router
	- Dynamically update connectivity information at all the routers

### Distance Vector Algorithm (Determining the Next-Hop)
- Each router maintains a routing table that consists of:
	- **Destination**: The destination IP address of the packet
	- **Link**: The outgoing link on which the packet should be forwarded
	- **Cost**: The *distance* between the router and the destination
		- Cost can be estimated as the total delay for the packet to reach the destination

### Distance Vector Algorithm (Updating the Connectivity Information)
- Connectivity is updated by **sharing** routing tables with other routers
- Router Information Protocol (**RIP**) is used for sending update messages
	- Send routing table to neighboring routers
		- Periodically, or when local table changes
	- When a neighborâ€™s routing table is received. (3 cases):

### Summary: Routing over Internet
- Each machine's local network over the Internet is identified by an IP Address
- Source machine transmits the packet over its local network
- Intermediate routers examine the packet, and forward it to the best next-hop router
- If the destination is directly attached to the local network of a router, the router forwards the packet over the respective local network
	- Cost/Delay is 0
- Routers exchange information to keep an up-to-date information about the network


### Transport Layer
- Transport layer protocols provide end-to-end communication for applications
- This is the lowest layer where ***messages (rather than packets)*** are handled
- Messages are addressed to **communication ports** attached to the processes
	- Transport Layer **multiplexes each packet received** to its specficed port 
				- ![[Pasted image 20231031203223.png]]

### Simple Transport Layer Protocols
- 2 Services
	- Multiplexing Service
	- Connection-Less Communication: (sender and receiver processes do not initiate a connection before sending the message)
		- Each message is encapsulated in a packet (also called as datagram)
		- Messages at the receiver can be in different order than the one sent by the sender
		- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

### Advanced Transport Layer Protocols
- Advanced transport layer protocols typically provide more services than simple multiplexing
	- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a widely used protocol (for reliability and guaranteed delivery) has these additional/overlapping features
		- **Connection-oriented Communication** (TCP establishes connection before message passing)
		- **Reliability**
		- **Congestion Control**

		#### 1. Connection Oriented Communication
		- Sender and receiver will handshake before sending the messages
			- Handshake helps to set-up connection parameters, and to allocate resources at destination to receive packets
		- Destination provides *in-order delivery* of messages to the intended process
			- Destination will buffer the packets until the previous packets have been received
			- It will then deliver packets to the process in the order that the user has sent them.
			- ![[Pasted image 20231101161631.png]]
		#### 2. Reliability
		- Packets may be lost in the network due to **buffer overflows at the router** or **transmission error(s)** 
		- In TCP, destination sends an **ACK to the sender**
			- If **ACK is not received at the sender**, the ***sender will infer a packet error***, and **retransmit the packet**

		#### 3. Congestion Control
		- Network Capacity is limited by the individual communication links and routers
			- Limited buffer space and link-bandwidth
		- A source transmits packets at a rate **greater than network capacity**?
			- Packets drop at intermediate routers
			- Corressponding ACK's will not be received at the source
			- The source retransmits
			- More packets build up on the router queue
			- Network Collapse
		- **Avoiding Congestion**
			- 1. Detect Congestion at Routers
				- If a router expects a buffer overflow, then it follows one of 2 strategies
					- Lets source detect packet loss and thereby reduce sending rate
					- Explicitly send ECN -> Explicit Congestion Notif to sender to reduce congestion
				- The **TCP Sender** reduces sending rate upon either determining packet loss or getting the ECN

**Horizontal Scaling is the adding of more machines to the system**
**Vertical Scaling is the spec increasing of a single machine**


###### Why Horizontal Scaling vs Vertical Scaling

##### What Horizontal Scaling Necessitates
- Programming and Concurrency Models
	- A way to express the problem as parallel processes and execute them on different machines
- Architectures
	- A way to organize processes
- Communication Paradigms
	- A way for distributed processes to exchange information
- Naming Protocols
	- A way to locate and share resources
- Synchronization
	- A way for distributed processes to cooperate, synchronize with one another, and agree on shared values
- Caching, Replication, and Consistency
	- A way to reduce latency, enhance reliability, and improve performance
- Virtualization
	- A way to enhance load scalability, reduce diversity across heterogeneous systems, and provide a high degree of portability and flexibility, along with security.
- Fault Tolerance
	- A way to recover from partial failures


**Distributed Systems:** 
- A collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a single coherent system
	- One in which components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages
- 4 Main Features
	- Geographical Separation
	- No Common Physical Clock
	- No Common Physical Memory
	- Autonomy and Heterogeneity
		- Autonomy 
			- Refers to the degree of independence that each node has in the distributed system.
			- This means each node/process in the system can make decisions on its own without referring to a central authority
			- Allows for nodes/processes to adapt to failuires
		- Heterogenity
			- Refers to the wide diversity of nodes/processes 
			- Each node/process can have different OS's, different hardware architecture, different communication protocols, and data formatting. 
**Parallel Systems**
- 4 Main Features
	- Strong Coupling
	- A Common Physical Clock
	- A Shared Physical Memory
	- Homogenity
		- All the machines in the system share the same hardware, software components
		- Homogeneity is about the similarity of the individual processing elements, such as CPUs or processing units, within the system

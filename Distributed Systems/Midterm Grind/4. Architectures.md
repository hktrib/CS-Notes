In distributed sys:
- Communicating Entities
	- Systems
- Communication Paradigm
	- RPC/SOCKETS

The roles and responsibilities that these entitities have are referred to as **Architectures**

## Two main Architectures
- #### Master Slave
	- Roles of the slave are **asymmetric**
- #### Peer-to-Peer Architecture
	- Roles of the peer are **symmetric**
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101180203.png]]



## Master Slave Architecture

- ##### Nodes are Unequal
	- Vulnerable to a single point of failuire (**SPOF**)
- ##### The master asks as the coordinator
	- Decision Making is easy -> master makes the decisions
- ##### The underlying system cannot scale out indefinetly
	- The Master will end up rendering a ***performance bottleneck*** to the end user as the number of workers is increased 
		- workers have to communicate with each other and master has to handle all those extra connections and synchronize the data being received

## Peer to Peer Architectures

- #### A peer-to-peer (**P2P**) architecture can be characterized as follows:
	- ##### 1. **All nodes are equal** 
		- No SPOF
	- ##### 2. A central coordinator is not needed
		- Decision making becomes harder
	- ##### 3. The underlying system can scale out indefinetly
		- In principle no performance bottleneck
	- ##### 4. Peers can interact directly, forming groups and sharing content (offering services to each other)
		- At least one peer will share the data and this peer **must be accessible**
		- Popular data will be highly available, many peers will share it
		- Unpopular data might eventually disappear and become unavailable as (more users/peers stop sharing them)
	- ##### 5. Peers can form a virtual |*overlay network*| on top of a physical network topology
		- Logical Paths do not usually match physical paths (latency hits in the logical path)
		- Each peer plays a role in routing traffic through the overlay network

### Unstructured P2P
- The architecture does not impose any particular structure on the overlayed network
- ##### Advantages:
	- Easy to build
	- Highly robust against high rates of ***churn*** (when a great deal of peers frequently join and leave the network)
- ##### Main Disadvantage:
	- Peers and contents are ***loosley coupled*** causing a data location and problem
		- Searching for data might require broadcasting a search query to all nodes

### Structured P2P
- The architecture imposes some structure on the overlayed network
- ##### Main Advantage:
	- Peers and contents are tightly coupled (e.g through hashing -> DHT -> dist hash table), simplifying data location
- ##### Disadvantages:
	- Harder to Build
	- For optimized data location, peers must maintain extra metadata (e.g lists of ***neighbours*** that satisfy specific criteria)
	- Less Robust against high rates of ***churn***
		- Because of how the metadata needs to be distributed upon the registry of peer in the system that satisfies such criteria

### Hybrid P2P
- The architecture can use some ***central servers*** to help peers locate each other
	- A combination of P2P and master-slave models
- Offers a trade-off in the ***centralized functionality of Master Slave*** and the ***Node Equality of the pure P2P model***
	- Combines the advantages and precludes the disadvantages of the master-slave and P2P models. 

## Architecture Patterns
- **Tiering**
	- horizontal splitting of services
- **Layering**
	- vertical splitting of services


### Tiering
- ##### A technique to 
	- Organize the functionality of a service and place the functionality into appropriate servers
	- ![[Pasted image 20231101191701.png]]

## Layering
- ##### A technique to 
	- Partition a complex system into layers
		- Upper layer utilizes the services of the lower layer
		- A vertical organization of services
	- #### Layering simplifies the design of complex distributed systems by hiding the complexity of below layers
		- ![[Pasted image 20231101192038.png]]

### Layering â€“ Platform and middleware
- #### Distributed Systems can be organized into 3 main layers
	- **Platform**
		- Low-level hardware and software layers
		- Provides common services for higher layers
	- **Middleware**
		- Masks heterogeneity and provides convenient programming models to application programmers
		- Typically, it simplifies application programming by abstracting communication mechanisms
	- **Applications**

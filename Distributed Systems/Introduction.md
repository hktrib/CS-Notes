#### Decentralized vs Distributed Systems

#### Definitions
- Decentralized System: a networked computer system in which processes and resources are **necessarily** spread across multiple computers
- Distributed System: a networked computer system in which processes and resources are **sufficiently** spread across multiple computers

- Both suffer from **partial failuires**
	- Some process/resource in the networked system is not operating to expectation
- Related to **partial failuires** processes/resources/nodes in a distributed/decentralized system come and go. 
	- Makes the system highly dynamic
		- Expert maintenance is required
- Since both types of system are networked, permissions cross over a wide range of nodes/processes/resources
	- Both vulnerable to security attacks


###### Sufficient vs Necessary
- In principle the less spreading the better


### Design Goals

##### Resource Sharing
- Make it easy for users to access and share remote resources
